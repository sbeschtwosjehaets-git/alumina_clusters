Abstract:
    Context. Aluminium oxide (alumina; Al2O3) is a promising candidate as
    a primary dust condensate in the atmospheres of oxygen-rich evolved 
    stars. Therefore, alumina 'seed' particles might trigger the onset of 
    stellar dust formation and of stellar mass loss in the wind. However, 
    the formation of alumina dust grains is not well understood.
    Aims. We aim to shed light on the initial steps of cosmic dust 
    formation (i.e. nucleation) in oxygen-rich environments via a quantum-
    chemical bottom-up approach.
    Methods. Starting with an elemental gas-phase composition, we 
    construct a detailed chemical-kinetic network that describes the
    formation and destruction of aluminium-bearing molecules and dust-
    forming (Al2O3)n clusters up to the size of dimers (n=2) coagulating 
    to tetramers (n=4). Intermediary species include the prevalent gas-
    phase molecules AlO and AlOH as well as AlxOy clusters with x=1-5, 
    y=1-6. The resulting extensive network is applied to two model stars, 
    which represent a semi-regular variable and a Mira type, and to 
    different circumstellar gas trajectories, including a non-pulsating 
    outflow and a pulsating model. The growth of larger-sized (Al2O3)n 
    clusters with n=4-10 is described by the temperature-dependent Gibbs 
    free energies of the most favourable structures (i.e. the global 
    minima clusters) as derived from global optimisation techniques and 
    calculated via density functional theory. We provide energies, bond 
    characteristics, electrostatic properties, and vibrational spectra of 
    the clusters as a function of size, n, and compare these to corundum, 
    which corresponds to the crystalline bulk limit (n to infinity).
    Results. The circumstellar aluminium gas-phase chemistry in oxygen-
    rich giants is primarily controlled by AlOH and AlO, which are tightly 
    coupled by the reactions AlO+H2, AlO+H2O, and their reverse. Models of 
    semi-regular variables show comparatively higher AlO abundances, as 
    well as a later onset and a lower efficiency of alumina cluster 
    formation when compared to Mira-like models. The Mira-like models 
    exhibit an efficient cluster production that accounts for more than 
    90% of the available aluminium content, which is in agreement with the 
    most recent ALMA observations. Chemical equilibrium calculations fail 
    to predict both the alumina cluster formation and the abundance trends 
    of AlO and AlOH in the asymptotic giant branch dust formation zone. 
    Furthermore, we report the discovery of hitherto unreported global 
    minimum candidates and low-energy isomers for cluster sizes n=7, 9, 
    and 10. A homogeneous nucleation scenario, where Al2O3 monomers are 
    successively added, is energetically viable. However, the formation of 
    the Al2O3 monomer itself represents an energetic bottleneck. 
    Therefore, we provide a bottom-up interpolation of the cluster 
    characteristics towards the bulk limit by excluding the monomer, 
    approximately following an n^(-1/3) dependence.

Description:
    Thermo-chemical tables of the most favourable (global minimum) molecules 
    and cluster candidates. The following species are included: 
    AlO, AlOH, AlO2, Al2O, Al2O2, Al2O3, Al4O6, Al6O9, AlH, AlCl, AlF, Al2, 
    Files ending on *_combo.txt use CBS-QB3 zero-point energies (T=0K) and 
    partiton functions based on the RRHO approximation and B3LYP/cc-pVTZ 
    rotational and vibrational temperatures. These correspond to the most 
    accurate calculations in our set.
